Why is it so late?

There was a bug that when I sent an empty search term as a request I would get a 404 error.
I waited until Mike's office hours today to show him the error and ask him different ways to
solve it. In retrospect I should have turned in my homework on time and dealt with the problem
later or pushed my change to the repository and ask Mike about the code.

It took me around 20 hours to complete. Most of the time I was just waiting for Mike's office
hours.

Completed the assignment on my own.
